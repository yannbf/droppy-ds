/**
 * Which experiment branches `experiment:publish-branches` should force-push.
 *
 * - `push`: configured branches that exist locally and differ from the remote.
 * - `upToDate`: configured branches whose remote ref already points at the local commit;
 *   pushing them would be a no-op that still costs a CI run, so they are skipped.
 * - `missing`: configured branches with no local branch — regenerate with
 *   `pnpm experiment:freeze` before publishing.
 * - `stray`: local `experiment/*` branches no longer in experiments.config.ts;
 *   they are skipped so retired experiments do not keep shipping.
